      <p>
         I am an Aspiring Web Developer with 12 years of work experience in Various IT backgrounds with the skills sets to show for it. I enjoy learning new technologies and expanding my horizons. My curiosity is engaged when I see how things work from the inside out, and in return I gain valuable experience and problem-solving skills. Great social skills from the get-go, working with others is never an issue and my communication skills are exemplary.

        I have always had a fascination with new technology and how things worked. Attending a bootcamp for web development was a beneficial experience to say in the least and has given me determination to only strive higher. I am eager to show off my skills that I have accrued from all these years and cannot wait to be put to the test.

        For instance, our first project in boot camp won 4 of the 6 awards that was offered. The “feeling” I had working together with my group and the team building experience that was gained that day, is crucial to who I am now. From then on, I focused on improving that certain feeling. I want to share that feeling with others, and that’s what I hope to bring into this industry.
